- append the name of the flickr photo in slug-form to the end of the photo/show links (params[:id].to_i strips it out in effect anyway)

- wrap all calls to flickr in begin and rescue blocks (logger.error in rescue)

- liquid layout-fu:

- need to fix up the syncing. ie. when changing tags, must remove/disable any photos that exist
  from a sync using the previous tag.
  
- need to verify that sync order is still correct (it looks like it is oldest first after a recent test)

- max says make it browse flickr sets

- make the error page look consistent with the rest of the app's theme (this should perhaps work with the wildcard route and the pages controller?)
