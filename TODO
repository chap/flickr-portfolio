- wrap all calls to flickr in begin and rescue blocks (logger.error in rescue)

- liquid layout-fu:

- need to fix up the syncing. ie. when changing tags, must remove/disable any photos that exist
  from a sync using the previous tag.
  
- need to verify that sync order is still correct (it looks like it is oldest first after a recent test)

- max says make it browse flickr sets
